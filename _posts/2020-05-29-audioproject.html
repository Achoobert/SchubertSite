<h3>What is It?</h3>
<p>
  The starting idea of this project was to help traveling workers in remote
  villages. They provide battery powered speakers which are fantastic for the
  elderly, blind, or the illiterate. <br />
  This app will help them to make sure that a 'user' gets new audio tracks every
  time they visit by tracking IDs of the 'given' files as they work. The export
  feature will let them easily and intuitively control the play order of the
  tracks.<br />
