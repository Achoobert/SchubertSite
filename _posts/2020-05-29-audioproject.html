        Context: A single manager, on a single device managing many user's
        listening
      </li>
      <li>
        Problem: Cannot keep track of what they've listened to before want to
        control the play order of the tracks
      </li>
      <li>
        Solution: make a library UI manager selects user, then drive, then audio
        files.
      </li>
      <li>
        The audio files can be dragged around in the 'playlist' to match the
        desired play order.
      </li>
      <li>
        Database will keep which tracks were sent to a drive, and will highlight
        them later.

<h3>What is It?</h3>
<p>
  The starting idea of this project was to help traveling workers in remote
  villages. They provide battery powered speakers which are fantastic for the
  elderly, blind, or the illiterate. <br />
  This app will help them to make sure that a 'user' gets new audio tracks every
  time they visit by tracking IDs of the 'given' files as they work. The export
  feature will let them easily and intuitively control the play order of the
  tracks.<br />
