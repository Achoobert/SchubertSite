   Hopefully a situation where I have to enforce one of these rules will never come up, but here are the rules for my
   games.
   If you feel that I or another player has violated any of these rules, please let me know privately.

<h2>Community Rules</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Respect for the community. Be respectful and kind to all other persons in our community. Hate speech,
      discrimination, harassment, or personal attacks toward other users will NOT be tolerated. We expressly affirm
      members of all faiths, creeds, sexual orientation</li>
   <li>Respect for the gamemaster. Respect that all players have the right to engage with me, particularly
      during game time. Avoid pinging, messaging, or otherwise distracting me while I am engaged in an
      active game session.</li>
   <li>No Spam. This includes spamming or flooding the forums or Discord servers. If you are looking for a game, please
      message me or look at my startplaying profile.</li>
      <li>No Advertisements or Streaming. This space is dedicated to premium games run by Isaac Schubert. Please don't
         post listings for outside games, advertisements, etc. without express permission from me. Setting
      up private, unpaid games with other players is obviously not prohibited, but please use private messages to get
      those established. Streaming of the paid sessions is strictly prohibited, unless propr permission was obtained. Failure
      to comply with this rule may result in a ban from the website, server, sessions, and
      additional legal liability.</li>
   <li>Play by the Rules. I personally reserve the right to screen, add, remove, or otherwise "manage" members of the
      community for whatever reason, but will automatically remove any member who upon warning continues to violate the
      Code of Conduct.</li>
   <li>No Hate. While this is an 18+ community, I will not tolerate posts or other communication depicting
      and/or advocating extreme violence, sexual violence, pornography, and/or personal attacks.
</ul>

<h2>Game Conduct</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Fun and safety first. I will behave in a manner that contributes to the fun and safety of others in the game and
      community.</li>
   <li>Let others speak. We play a tabletop game in a digital setting which can make discourse difficult if multiple
      individuals speak over one another. If I notice another member, including a gamemaster, wanting to contribute to
      the conversation, I will strive to conclude my point and let them contribute. Simultaneously, after you have made
      your wish to contribute known, wait until the current speak concludes to contribute.</li>
   <li>Respect lines and veils. While we do not expressly prohibit mature language in our games, all conduct must be
      tempered by a game member's expressed "lines and veils." A line is something that an individual has expressed as
      an absolute no-go topic. A veil is something that an individual does not enjoy discussing or hearing, but will
      tolerate as an organic part of the story's development.</li>
   <li>Limit rules arguments. Follow the gamemaster's lead, avoid arguing with them or other players for the sake of
      argument. The gamemaster is the final rules arbiter concerning things within their game. Their job is to function
      as a story facilitator and final rules arbitrator. Whatever your gamemaster decides is the final say and
      attempting to rehash arguments, particularly during game time, will not be tolerated.</li>
   <li>No aggressive behavior. This includes threats of, including actual, verbal or physical aggression towards another
      person; using racial, gender, or cultural slurs against another person; otherwise harassing a person, particularly
      when that person specifically asked for the behavior to stop.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Prohibited Behavior</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Disruptive Behavior</li>
   <li>Unsafe Behavior</li>
   <li>Aggressive Behavior</li>
   <li>Harassment</li>
   <li>Innuendos directed at an individual about their physique/sexuality</li>
   <li>Remarks about a person's political affiliation</li>
   <li>Unwanted messages, letters, calls, emails, gifts, or any other form of contact</li>
   <li>Unwelcome requests for dates</li>
   <li>Talking on phone / other distractions without excusing oneself during gameplay</li>
   <li>Arguing a rule after the game has moved on</li>
   <li>Intentionally making someone feel isolated or excluded</li>
   <li>Spreading rumors about another</li>
   <li>Belittling another for whatever reason</li>
   <li>Directed threats of intent to harm or threatening behavior</li>
   <li>Opposing or challenging everything a particular person suggests</li>
</ul>
