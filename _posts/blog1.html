Blog 1: tracking progress with written entries
I am going to write these in the style of written reports to a therapist/ coach.Perhaps other readers may find it
useful.If so, you can buy me a coffee here: *cofi link*
What
The objective is to make myself set a limited number of objectives, then to take the time to reflect on my
implementation.Take the time before and after to explain to a third party (chat) what the actual goal is.WhyA plethora
of various objectives, constant input from “improvement” content has made consistent use of techniques difficultLimiting
the WIP items prevents scope creepCondensing data down so that a third party could understand forces me to clarify
exactly what I want.If concise, I can use it as reference later ( or while WIP!! )Is basically documentation for
personal firmware tweaksWhenThree other goals must have been reached.I can game it by making other tasks really
smallEven so, it’s going to be… several weeks. - HARD DATE June 9th: 4:20 pm, 20241 - create (max) three written
entries. As they are “completed” they can be archived.For example: once I have three other ‘completed’ entries, I will
judge this initial goal as completed, and this post this to my personal blog + archive this note + open another slot for
me to try something.2 - run it through gippity for proof reading3 - post all (4) entries to my personal blog

4 - ??? 5 - ProfitResipein order to start I need to - [x] subscribe to apple drive so this notes app will sync $ 1$ a
month - write the goals down here
- have a note taking app

In order to increase my chance of victory
reminder: - [ ] set calendar notification: weekly - [ ] set reminder: weekly - [ ]
reward
- [!] I get to post this blog - [!] Post to family group chat and flex on siblings
- [!] Binge an entire anime guilt free - [!] ask Ice for special hanky panky - [!] Finish Titanfall 2 (guilt free)
Fail state
- [ ] Throw away citadel paint pot for every day past deadline.explain:Daily notifications get ignored too easily.
Weekly seems to be my sweet spot. Reminders are CRITICALreward, things I actually really want, won’t kill me, and I can
attach to X as motivation. Are IMPORTANT
I would rate this objective as 5% likely to succeed

Battle report:entry 1: may 9th, 7:20 am3 frameworks/blogs are writtemI am very tempted to try and think of a 4th goal
HOWEVER, the whole point is to focusNeed to setup calendar to make work happen tomorrow. I also want to save this data
to a repo so it doesn’t dissapear into the ether of an unknown test writing app. This is two hours worth of effort at
this point.
