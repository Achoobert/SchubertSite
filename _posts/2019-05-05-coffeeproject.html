  >The core values of Silaa Farms are quality and consistency. They have made it
  a priority to build quality control checks into every stage of their
  production process, and have trained their employees to understand and
  thoroughly perform each check.<br />
  Maintaining consistency in the coffee roasting stage was one quality control
  area Silaa Coffee wanted to improve. Located in a backwater village in
  northern Thailand, the 500kg roaster collects sensor and spin data while
  roasting, and stores it locally. This data can be downloaded directly by
  accessing the IP of the roaster and viewing an HTTP interface. Currently, an
  expert visits the village every week or so and downloads the data from the
  coffee roaster onto a laptop and then takes it away to analyze. However,
  visiting so frequently was becoming burdensome, and they wanted to have a
  local employee be able to pull the data from the roaster and put it online for
  the expert to analyze.

  >The goal for us was to create a simple, hopefully, automated
  solution--ideally one which was very easy and simple to use--to upload data
  about all the roasts from the coffee roaster to Google Drive so they can be
  quickly looked at for reference and quality control. This challenge was dubbed
  #InternetOfBeans.<br />

  During the Hackathon, our team tackled this problem. Rather than requiring a
  laptop and heavy manual processing, the approach taken was to invest in a
  Raspberry Pi and give it a button and LED. The roaster presses the button just
  before it turns itself off. The LED lights up for at least two seconds, during
  which the data is pulled from the roaster and uploaded to the internet. Once
  the data is safely transferred, the LED is extinguished and the roaster can
  turn off the machine. This way the data is synced to Google Drive and can be
  accessed remotely anytime.<br />

  Now, the software component of the project has been implemented and is working
  well. It is saving roast information that was getting lost after a certain
  number of days, dividing up the day's data into individual roasts, and
  converting that information into usable data. With the data being synced to
  Google drive automatically, it can be accessed remotely with one click and
  easily analyzed to get a good feel for the consistency of the roasts. This all
  ensures that the coffee continues to be the high-quality product that Silaa
  Farms is known for.
