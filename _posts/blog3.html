Blog 3: Spend regular time at gym

I am going to write these in the style of written reports to a therapist/ coach.Perhaps other readers may find it
useful.If so, you can buy me a coffee here: *cofi link*What:
Spend a full hour, three times a week, at Lions Den.Don’t have to lift or stretch, working at desk is encouraged.

Why:
Practice going to locationmake location more psychologically comfortable
It is a club I am running, I need to inspect premises more often
I invested in making it a working space, I need to use it
Changing my environment is OBJECTIVELY positive for my outputWhereLions den

How:Take MacBook to gym, work thereWhen6 sessions, ie, two weeks. The faster I do this, the faster I can make a 4th

In order to increase my chance of victory
reminders: - [ ]
reward
- [!] I get to post this blog - [!] buy helldivers or a standing desk for my office
Fail state
- [ ] other task will have less timeBrutally honest evaluation:
I would rate this objective as 20% likely to succeed I have MANY things coming up, and many excuses to not go to this
location
Tracking the items I already have ready to go is an encouraging factor.I need to “game it” in order to increase my
chance of success. Go three consecutive days go there and hangout without actually accomplishing any workgo there and
listen to a podcast or meditate
(Note, all of these gaming options are acceptable and actually productive, but they ‘feel’ like cheating)
