   <p>
      In the world of personal development, speed and affordability matter. People seek self-improvement precisely because
      they have limited resources. 'Change My Own Mind' was born out of my passion for self-improvement and a need for a
      time and cost-effective solution.

   <h2>Creation</h2>
   <p>
      Built in just two hours on my brother's GPT account, 'Change My Own Mind' combines AI-generated text with the concept of
      self-hypnosis.
      </p>
   <h2>Why 'Change My Own Mind'?</h2>
   <p>
      I've always found online scripts too generic. This tool lets me quickly convert topics into personalized scripts. It's
      for those who want affordable, tailored self-improvement tools.
      </p>
   <h2>Accessibility</h2>
   <p>
      I wanted to make self-improvement more accessible. To help people starting out skip the steps of having to learn the
      details of how hypnosis works in order to write or edit a script that applies to them. It's a simple project that
      leverages existing tools.
   </p>
   <h2>Overcoming Skepticism</h2>
   <p>
      Hypnosis is a powerful tool that many people are intimidated by. I don't doubt that many people reading this post will
      remain skeptical.
      </p>
   <h2>Invitation</h2>
   <p>
      All I can ask those people is to try writing their own script with this tool and see what happens.
