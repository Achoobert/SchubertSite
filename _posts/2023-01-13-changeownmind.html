<p>
   In the world of personal development, speed and affordability matters. The whole reason somone wants to improve
   themselves is BECAUSE they have limited resources. 'Change My Own Mind' was born out of my passion for
   self-improvement and a need for a time and cost-effective solution. Built in just two hours on my brother's GPT
   account, it combines the ai generated text with the idea of and self-hypnosis.
</p>
<p>
   I've always found online scripts too generic. This tool lets me quickly convert topics into personalized scripts.
   It's for those who want affordable, tailored self-improvement tools.
</p>
<p>
   I wanted to make self-improvement more accessible. To help people starting out skip the steps of having to learn the
   details of how hypnosis works in order to write or edit a script that applies to them. It's a simple project that
   leverages existing tools.
</p>
<p>
   Quite frankly, hypnosis is a powerful tool that many people are intimidated by. I don't doubt that many people
   reading this very post will remain skeptical.
</p>
<p>
   All I can ask those people is to try writing their own script with this tool and see what happens.
