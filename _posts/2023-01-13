<p>
In the world of personal development, speed and affordability matters. The whole reason somone wants to improve themselves is BECAUSE they have limited resources. 'Change My Own Mind' was born out of my passion for self-improvement and a need for a time and cost-effective solution. Built in just two hours on my brother's GPT account, it combines the ai generated text with the idea of and self-hypnosis.

I've always found online scripts too generic. This tool lets me quickly convert topics into personalized scripts. It's for those who want affordable, tailored self-improvement tools.
</p><p>
I wanted to make self-improvement more accessible. To help people starting out skip the steps of having to learn the details of how hypnosis works in order to write or edit a script that applies to them. It's a simple project that leverages existing tools.
