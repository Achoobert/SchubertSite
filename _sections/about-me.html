<p>
  I was born and raised in rural Montana. It seems like only a short while ago
  that I first got on a plane to visit India for a few months, and ended up
  staying for two years. <br />It's been 6 years so far, and I've been having a
  blast.<br />
  I really love making tools that help people, and give them freedom from boring
  or repetitive tasks. Or even get them access to tools or data they only
  dreamed of previously
